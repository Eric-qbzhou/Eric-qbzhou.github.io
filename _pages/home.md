I'm currently pursuing a Master degree at [Nantong University](https://www.ntu.edu.cn/), in a research group managed by [Prof. Xiaomin Chen](https://sist.ntu.edu.cn/2020/0429/c5301a139222/page.htm). Before this, I received the B.S. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from Nantong University in June, 2019. My master research interests mainly include network coding and forward error correction. Because of lab cooperation, I know some about other aspects, like multiple input multiple output (MIMO), reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and machine learning.

**Research interest:** wireless communications and networking, error-control coding, forward error correction, information theory, and network coding.
